# Simulator

Building a simple RISC-V core simulator in C++.

The main goals of this projects is to:
- Get a deeper understanding of Computer Architecture
- Gain more experience in writing complex software systems in C++

## Steps:

1. Build a intruction level simulator
2. Update it to be a more complex pipelined design
3. Add branch prediction
4. Add caches
5. Support out-of-order execution
6. Suppport multicores
7. Ensure cache coherency
8. Other imporovements may include prefetching, multithreading support, etc.
