# Simulator

Building a simple RISC-V core simulator in C++.

The main goals of this projects is to:
- Get a deeper understanding of Computer Architecture
- Gain more experience in writing complex software systems in C++

## Steps:

- [ ] Build a intruction level simulator
- [ ] Update it to be a more complex pipelined design
- [ ] Add branch prediction
- [ ] Add caches
- [ ] Support out-of-order execution
- [ ] Suppport multicores
- [ ] Ensure cache coherency
- [ ] Other imporovements may include prefetching, multithreading support, etc.
